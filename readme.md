Need to create a project projection to track future goals for features.

Using Trello to Track goals for each feature development. Try to check Git Branches for specific features. 

-- Overall 
Will most likely be slowly isolating this app; will migrate to a Django based app. Trying to solve issues associated with the use of java swing. Will likely still use some API features, via 3rd party shell execution. Planning on releasing Django release under this REPO. HOWEVER, Should create an isolated copy of this branch to a version branch, so as to keep code constant for this release of the app.
